# Image Search Abstraction Layer

## Objective: 
Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that allows you to search for images like  
**[this page](https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10)**
and browse recent search queries like 
**[this page](https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch/)**.
Then deploy it to Glitch.

Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit [This Page](https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects).

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

## User Story: 
>1. I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.

>2. I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.

>3. I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.

### Note
For this Project, I tried to get a code more modular, clean and easy to understand.
